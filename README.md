#A simple GPS sentence parser

_**Work in progress!**_

Intention is to have it parse all possible NMEA sentences sent out by a GPS unit.
Currently I have access to only an Adafruit Ultimate GPS breakout unit, so
initial release will be for all the sentences it spits out.

**Installation**  

```npm install node-gps-parser --save```

*Status*

GPGGA : Parsing done  
GPRMC : Parsing done   
GPGSA : Parsing done
